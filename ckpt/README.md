RADAR is a generalist vision-language model trained on over 400,000 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT examinations with 15 million anatomy-aware image–text pairs, learning directly from clinical reports without manual annotation. RADAR provides a scalable and versatile framework for radiology AI, demonstrating expert-level performance across both routine and complex clinical tasks.
